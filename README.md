### Tips :

- `<React.fragment> </React.Fragment>`  (Shortcut : <></>) : virtual element not shown in the DOM, allowed to return more than one JSX element

### Notes :

Component names in React must be capitalized so that its instance in JSX is not considered as DOM/HTML tag.

**Prop drilling** : Getting data from component A down to component B through the props. Where component A is the parent of B.
